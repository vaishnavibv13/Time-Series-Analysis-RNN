## Problem statement


This project predicts the vechicle miles traveled for the year 2019.



### Data Collection & Cleaning

Data is obtained from FRED economics Data (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TRFVOLUSM227NFWA)

The data represents vechicle Miles traveled 
(in Millions) from the year 1970 to 2018.



### Modeling
 This step creates a Recurrent neural network model with 10 epochs.<br><br>
